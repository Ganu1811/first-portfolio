three types of machine learning
supervised 
unsupervised
reinforcement


supervised types

1 - linear regression - labeled data dependent variable varies linerly with independent variable (prediction by finding mean variance standard deviation)
2 - logistic regression - binary (true or false)
3 - decision tree - parent child nodes
4 - random forest - for greater accuracy
5 - knn - k nearest neighbour (find nearest neighbour and make class)

linear regression

y = theta1x + theta0

two types 
single and multiple
